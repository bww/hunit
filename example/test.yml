# This one compares entities semantically. The entities are unmarshaled into
# objects and the objects are compared. This allows you to ignore insignificant
# differences like whitespace, formatting, and property order.
# 
# Semantically compared objects also ignore properties which are not present
# in the provided "expected" entity. This allows you to compare only the
# properties that you're interested and ignore properties that are unpredictable,
# such as timestamps or identifiers generated by the service.
